##
## This section the data utilized for this analysis is sourced from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), World Bank 
## (WB), and United Nations (UN). The first data set is from the UNODC which includes the variables for prices retail and wholesale 
## cocaine in West and Central Europe, as well as the US. 

##
## The data sets 
## [1] "price_dollar_western_europe.xlsx" includes the variables for price per gram (cocaine) for wholesale and retail in West and 
## Central Europe (1996-2019).
## [2] "wb_gdp_export_import" includes variables for export of goods and services and import of goods and services, population, 
## military government expenditure, Gross Net Income (GNI), and Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

## Cleaning the data sets

## Cocaine retail price in West and Central Europe, 1996-2019.
## "price_dollar_western_europe.xlsx" includes the variables for price per gram (cocaine) for wholesale and retail in West and 
## Central Europe (1996-2019).
