## First, load the World Bank data set for the selected countries between the years 1996 and 2019.
wb <- read_excel("datasets/P_Popular Indicators.xlsx")
head(wb) # Give the data a sneak peek. 

## This data set includes the following variables: 

## [1] First group is related to "Exports of goods and services". 
## In this group, the variables include (a) "Exports of goods and services (% of GDP)", (b) "Exports of goods and services (current
## US$)", and (c) "Exports of goods and services (annual % growth)".

## [2] The second group is related to "Imports of goods and services". 
## In this group, the variables include (d) "Imports of goods and services (% of GDP)", (e) "Imports of goods and services (current
## US$)", and (f) "Imports of goods and services (annual % growth)".

## [3] The third group is related to "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)". 
## In this group, the variables include (g) "GDP (current US$)", (h) "GDP growth (annual %)", (i) "GDP per capita (current US$)", 
## (j) "GDP per capita growth (annual %)", and (k) "GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)".

## [4] The last group is related to "Military expenditure". 
## In this group, including the variables (l) "Military expenditure (% of GDP)", (m) "Military expenditure (% of general government 
## expenditure", and (n) "Military expenditure (current USD)".
