# This data set includes the following variables: 

# [1] First group is related to "Exports of goods and services". In this group, the variables include (a) 
# "Exports of goods and services (% of GDP)", (b) "Exports of goods and services (current US$)", and (c) "Exports 
# of goods and services (annual % growth)".

# [2] The second group is related to "Imports of goods and services". In this group, the variables include (d) 
# "Imports of goods and services (% of GDP)", (e) "Imports of goods and services (current US$)", and (f) "Imports 
# of goods and services (annual % growth)".

# [3] The third group is related to "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)". In this group, the variables include (g) "GDP 
# (current US$)", (h) "GDP growth (annual %)", (i) "GDP per capita (current US$)", (j) "GDP per capita growth 
# (annual # %)", and (k) "GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)".

# [4] The last group is related to "Military expenditure". In this group, include the variables (l) "Military 
# expenditure (% of GDP)", (m) "Military expenditure (% of general government expenditure", and (n) "Military 
# expenditure (current USD)".
