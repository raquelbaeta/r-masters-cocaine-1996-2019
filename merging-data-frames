## Packages needed for merging the data frames
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("countrycode")
install.packages("data.table")

## Load packages 
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(countrycode)
library(data.table)

## This is the set Working directory.
setwd("/Users/raquelbaeta/Desktop/working_sessions")

## In this script, the following data frames are merged, "wgi", "wb", "eu_avg", "us_avg" and "seizures". 

## First, 'wb" data frame is merged with the "wgi" data frame.

## Load the csv files that created in "wb_indicators" and "wgi_indicators".
wb <- read_csv("csv_files/wb.csv")
wgi <- read_csv("csv_files/wgi.csv")

## Join the dtaa frames by country name, country code and year.
wb_wgi <- full_join(wb, wgi, by = c("country", "code", "year"))

## Second, 'eu_avg" data frame is merged with the "us_avg" data frame.

## Load the csv files that created in "eu_avg" and "us_avg".
eu_avg <- read_csv("csv_files/eu_avg.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
eu_cocaine <- read_csv("csv_files/eu_cocaine.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
us_avg <- read_csv("csv_files/us_avg.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

## Select and bind the rows related to the retail prices of cocaine in the United States and Europe.
retail <- bind_rows(rename(select(eu_avg, country, year, eu_rtl), rtl_avg = eu_rtl),
                    rename(select(us_avg, country, year, us_rtl_avg), rtl_avg = us_rtl_avg)
            )

retail_inflation <- bind_rows(rename(select(eu_cocaine, country, year, eu_rtl_wghted_infltn_euro),
                              rtl_wght_infl = eu_rtl_wghted_infltn_euro),
                             rename(select(us_avg, country, year, us_rtl_infltn_avg), rtl_wght_infl = us_rtl_infltn_avg)
            )

## Join "retail" and "retail_inflation" together.
retail <- full_join(retail, retail_inflation, by = c("country", "year"))

## Select and bind the rows related to the wholesale prices of cocaine in the United States and Europe.

## Bind European and American wholesale averages
wholesale <- bind_rows(rename(select(eu_avg, country, year, eu_wholsl), wholsl_avg = eu_wholsl),
                       rename(select(us_avg, country, year, us_wholsl_avg), wholsl_avg = us_wholsl_avg)
  )
  
## Bind the European and American inflation prices.
wholesale_inflation <- bind_rows(rename(select(eu_cocaine, country, year, eu_wholsl_wghted_infltn_euro), 
                                 ws_wght_infl = eu_wholsl_wghted_infltn_euro),

                                 ws_wght_infl = us_wholsl_infltn_avg)
  )

## Join "wholesale" and "wholsale_inflation:" together.
wholesale <- full_join(wholesale, wholsale_inflation, by = c("country", "year"))

## Join  both "retail" and "wholesale" data frames.
prices <- full_join(retail, wholesale, by = c("country", "year"))

## Remove "Un-weighted average, in US$" rows, and rename "Weighted* average, US$" to "United States of America".
prices <- filter(prices, country != "Unweighted average, in US$")
prices <- mutate(prices, country = ifelse(country == "Weighted* average, US$", "United States of America", country))

## Add country codes to the data frame to merge later.
prices$code <- countrycode(prices$country, origin = "country.name", destination = "iso3c")

## Load the csv files that created in "seizures" and "untreaties".
seizures <- read_csv("csv_files/seizures.csv")
untreaties <- read_csv("csv_files/untreaties.csv")


## Add country codes to the data frame.
seizures$code <- countrycode(seizures$country, origin = "country.name", destination = "iso3c")

## Join  both "prices" and "seizures" data frames.
cocaine <- full_join(prices, seizures, by = c("country", "code", "year"))
cocaine <- select(cocaine, region, subregion, country, code, year, group, drug, wholsl_avg, rtl_avg, rtl_wght_infl,       
                  ws_wght_infl, seizure)

## Export the data frames to a CSV file named "cocaine".
fwrite(cocaine, "cocaine.csv")

## Join  both "wb_wgi" and "cocaine" data frames.
data <- full_join(wb_wgi, cocaine, by = c("country", "code", "year"))
colnames(data)

## Join  both "data" and "untreaties" data frames.
data <- full_join(data, untreaties, by = c("country", "code", "region"))
colnames(data)

## Reorder the columns into a more sensible order.
data <- select(data, country, code, year, region, subregion, population,
               un1961, un1971, un1988, 
               group, drug,

## Remove duplicates created by the merge 
data <- data[!duplicated(data), ]

## Export the data frames to a CSV file named "data".
fwrite(data, "data.csv")

## Remove the data sets that were merged.
rm(wb, wgi, wb_wgi, eu_avg, us_avg, retail, retail_inflation, wholesale, wholsale_inflation, prices, seizures, cocaine)
