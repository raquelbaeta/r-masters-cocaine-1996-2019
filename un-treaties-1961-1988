## Packages needed for merging the data frames
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("readxl")
install.packages("data.table")
install.packages("countrycode")

## Load packages 
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
library(data.table)
library(countrycode)

## This is the set Working directory.
setwd("/Users/raquelbaeta/Desktop/working_sessions")

## Load the treaty data from the "un_treaty" file.
untreaties <- read_excel("datasets/un_treaty.xlsx")

## To analyse state commitment to international drug control treaties, the values are converting to numeric.

## Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971.

## The Convention establishes an international control system for psychotropic substances. It responded to the diversification and expansion of the spectrum 
## of drugs of abuse and introduced controls over a number of synthetic drugs according to their abuse potential on the one hand and their therapeutic value 
## on the other. Notes: 35 (signatories), and 184 (parties).

## as.numeric function converts logical expressions to 0 or 1 based on whether a country has signed a treaty or not.
untreaties$un1971 <- ifelse(untreaties$un1971 > 0, 1, 0)

## Convert NA to 0 in column A
untreaties$un1971[is.na(untreaties$un1971)] <- 0

##
## Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961

## This Convention aims to combat drug abuse by coordinated international action. There are two forms of intervention and control that work together.
## First, it seeks to limit the possession, use, trade in, distribution, import, export, manufacture and production of drugs exclusively for medical and 
## scientific purposes. Second, it combats drug trafficking through international cooperation to deter and discourage drug traffickers.

## as.numeric function converts logical expressions to 0 or 1 based on whether a country has signed a treaty or not.
untreaties$un1961 <- ifelse(untreaties$un1961 > 0, 1, 0)

## Convert NA to 0 in column A
untreaties$un1961[is.na(untreaties$un1961)] <- 0

##
## United Nations Convention against illicit traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988

## This Convention provides comprehensive measures against drug trafficking, including provisions against money laundering and the diversion of precursor 
## chemicals. It provides for international cooperation through, for example, extradition of drug traffickersâ€™ controlled deliveries and transfer of 
## proceedings. Notes: 88 (signatories), and 191 (parties).

## as.numeric function converts logical expressions to 0 or 1 based on whether a country has signed a treaty or not.
untreaties$un1988 <- ifelse(untreaties$un1988 > 0, 1, 0)

## Convert NA to 0 in column A
untreaties$un1988[is.na(untreaties$un1988)] <- 0

## Add a column with ISO 3-letter codes
untreaties$code <- countrycode(untreaties$country, origin = "country.name", destination = "iso3c")

## Add a column with continent names
untreaties$region <- countrycode(untreaties$code, origin = "iso3c", destination = "continent")

## Export the data frames to a CSV file named "data".
fwrite(untreaties, "untreaties.csv")
