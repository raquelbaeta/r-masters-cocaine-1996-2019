# Install Required Packages
install.packages("readxl") # work with Excel files
install.packages("dplyr") # data manipulation

# Load Libraries

# Step 1: Read the Excel file "un_treaty.xlsx" into a data frame named untreaties.
untreaties <- read_excel("un_treaty.xlsx")
head(untreaties) # preview the first few rows

# Step 2: Filter out rows corresponding to countries "United States of America" and "United Kingdom" as these countries were dropped 
# from the analysis.
untreaties <- untreaties %>%
  filter(country != "United States of America", country != "United Kingdom")

# Step 3: Convert the treaty values in columns un1971, un1961, and un1988 to numeric values ("0" for no commitment or "1" for 
# commitment) using the ifelse function.
untreaties$un1971 <- ifelse(untreaties$un1971 > 0, 1, 0)
untreaties$un1961 <- ifelse(untreaties$un1961 > 0, 1, 0)
untreaties$un1988 <- ifelse(untreaties$un1988 > 0, 1, 0)

# Step 4: Replace any missing values in the treaty columns with 0.
untreaties$un1971[is.na(untreaties$un1971)] <- 0
untreaties$un1961[is.na(untreaties$un1961)] <- 0
untreaties$un1988[is.na(untreaties$un1988)] <- 0

# Step 5: Add new columns code and region to the data frame. The code column contains ISO 3-letter country codes, and the region 
# column contains continent names.
untreaties$code <- countrycode(untreaties$country, 
                               origin = "country.name", 
                               destination = "iso3c")

untreaties$region <- countrycode(untreaties$code, 
                                 origin = "iso3c", 
                                 destination = "continent")

# Step 6: Export the cleaned data frame untreaties to a CSV file named "untreaties.csv".
fwrite(untreaties, "untreaties.csv")
