# This data set includes the following variables: 
# [1] Voice and Accountability: The extent to which a country’s citizens are able to participate in selecting 
# their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association and free media.

# [2] Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism: The likelihood that the government will be 
# destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including domestic violence and terrorism.

# [3] Government Effectiveness: The quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree 
# of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the 
# credibility of the government’s commitment to such policies.

# [4] Regulatory Quality: The ability of the government to provide sound policies and regulations that enable 
# and promote private sector development.

# [5] Rule of Law: The extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in 
# particularly the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the 
# likelihood of crime and violence.

# [6] Control of Corruption: The extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both 
# petty and grand forms of corruption, as well as "capture" of the state by elites and private interests.

# Rename the columns for later manipulation.
