## First, load the World Bank data set for the selected countries between the years 1996 and 2019.
wgi <- read_excel("datasets/wgi_indicators.xlsx")
head(wgi) # Give the data a sneak peak 

## This data set includes the following variables: 

## [1] Voice and Accountability: 
## The extent to which a country’s citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of 
## expression, freedom of association and free media.

## [2] Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism: 
## The likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including 
## domestic violence and terrorism.

## [3] Government Effectiveness: 
## The quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures,
## the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government’s commitment to such policies.

## [4] Regulatory Quality: 
## The ability of the government to provide sound policies and regulations that enable and promote private sector development.

## [5] Rule of Law: 
## The extent to which agents have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract 
## enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence.

## [6] Control of Corruption: 
## The extent to which public power is exercised for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of corruption, as well 
## as "capture" of the state by elites and private interests1.

## Rename the columns for later manipulation.
