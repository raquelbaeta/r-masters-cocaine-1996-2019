## This is the set Working directory for the analysis.
setwd("/Users/raquelbaeta/Desktop/working_sessions/datasets")

## This section the data utilized for this analysis is sourced from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), World Bank 
## (WB), and United Nations (UN). The first data set is from the UNODC which includes the variables for prices retail and wholesale 
## cocaine in West and Central Europe, as well as the US. 

##
## The data sets 
## [1] "price_dollar_western_europe.xlsx" includes the variables for price per gram (cocaine) for wholesale and retail in West and 
## Central Europe (1996-2019).
## [2] "wb_gdp_export_import" includes variables for export of goods and services and import of goods and services, population, 
## military government expenditure, Gross Net Income (GNI), and Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

## Cleaning the data sets

##
## [1]
## Cocaine retail price in West and Central Europe, 1996-2019.
## "price_dollar_western_europe.xlsx" includes the variables for price per gram (cocaine) for wholesale and retail in West and 
## Central Europe (1996-2019).

##
## Load the data set from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (1996-2019)

colnames(eu_retail)[1] <- "Country" # Rename the first column.
head(eu_retail) # Check

##
## Removing the excess years not included in the study (1990 to 1995 and 2020). 
eu_retail[2:7] <- NULL # Remove the years from 1990 to 1995.
eu_retail[26] <- NULL # Remove the year 2020.
head(eu_retail) # Check

##
## Transform the data set so that "euro_retail" is the variable.

## Annual averages adjusted, weighted and unweighted for prices of cocaine in Western and Central Europe.

##
## Make a data set for the annual averages, and annual weighted averages. Create a variable for un-weighted average retail price for 
## cocaine (US$ Dollars) in West and Central Europe between 1996-2019.
re_unweighted_avg <- eu_retail[409:432, 2:3]

## Create a variable for weighted average in US$ dollar 
re_weighted_avg <- eu_retail[433:456, 2:3]
colnames(re_weighted_avg)[2] <- "re_weighted_avg"
head(re_weighted_avg)

##
## Create a variable for weighted average in euro 
re_weighted_euro_avg <- eu_retail[457:480, 2:3]
colnames(re_weighted_euro_avg)[2] <- "re_weighted_euro_avg"

##
## Create a variable for inflation weighted average in euro.
re_inflation_euro_avg <- eu_retail[481:504, 2:3]
colnames(re_inflation_euro_avg)[2] <- "re_inflation_euro_avg"
head(re_inflation_euro_avg)

##
## Merge all the data sets together 
eu_retail_avg <- data.frame(re_unweighted_avg, re_weighted_avg, re_weighted_euro_avg, re_inflation_euro_avg)

##
## Remove the additional years that accumulated during the merge above.
eu_retail_avg[3] <- NULL # Remove "Year.1"
eu_retail_avg[4] <- NULL # Remove "Year.2"
eu_retail_avg[5] <- NULL # Remove "Year.3"
head(eu_retail_avg) # Check

##
## Clean up work environment before cleaning the data relating to cocaine whole-
## sale prices in West and Central Europe, 1996-2019.
